This document introduces how to download rouge-server and install it. It assumes you are confortable with some advanced computer tasks such as unziping a file and installing a service or a deamon.

=What is Rouge?=

Rouge Server is a highly customizable and modular Massively Multi-player Online (MMO) game server. An API is provides for Java and Objective-C is provided, making it ideal for Android and iOS. It provides basic communication services between players, some data sharing functionality and permanent data storage.

Rouge Server is licensed under the Apache Licenses 2.0 and uses a collection of libraries, most of them also under the Apache license or under the MIT license. There is also the MySQL JDBC connector, which is licensed under the GPL, under the FOSS exception.

=Getting and Installing Rouge=

In the download section, you will find the latest "stable" version of Rouge.
The download will be packaged as a zip file, which you can simply unzip
in the directory where you want to install Rouge.


Otherwise, you can checkout the latest copy of Rouge from the Subversion
repository. Also care is taken to keep the code in the repository stable, it's
highly likely to be buggy and broken. Compiling Rouge from source is easy and 
only requires Java and Ant. Once you have

=Configuration=

Most of the configuraton for Rouge can be found in the config.properties file
in the config file. From there, you can customize the server ports and available 
server commands. Unless you have experience with Rouge, I wouldn't customize
the file too much. Just make sure you change the administration password.

=Running=

On Linux, you can start the server using the start.sh schell script. On windows,
use the start batch file.

If you are working with the source from the SVN, you can also compile and
start the server using the "ant run" command.

==Running as a Daemon==

In the scripts directory, you'll find a shell script that can be used to
configure a Java application as a Daemon. Until I finish configuring it,
you're on your own.

==Running as a Service==

This section will be completed once I finish the appropriate wrappers.

=Marking sure it works=

Once you have started the server, point a browser to http://hostname:8090/ where
hostname is the host name of the machine where Rouge is running. You should
see the administration console.

=And beyond=
